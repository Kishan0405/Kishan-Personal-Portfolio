## 🚀 Getting Started

Want to run this portfolio locally on your machine? Follow these steps to set it up using **XAMPP**, a popular local server environment for PHP-based projects.

### Prerequisites
- **XAMPP**: Download and install from [https://www.apachefriends.org/](https://www.apachefriends.org/).
- **Git**: To clone this repository.
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
- A passion for coding and creativity! 😄

### Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone this project to your local machine using Git:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kishan-Raj/Kishan-Personal-Portfolio.git
   ```

2. **Set Up XAMPP**  
   - Install XAMPP and start the **Apache** and **MySQL** modules from the XAMPP control panel.
   - Copy the cloned repository folder to the `htdocs` directory in your XAMPP installation (e.g., `C:\xampp\htdocs\` on Windows).

3. **Configure the Project**  
   - Navigate to the project folder: `htdocs/Kishan-Personal-Portfolio`.
   - If the project uses a database (e.g., for dynamic features like contact forms), set up a MySQL database:
     - Open `http://localhost/phpmyadmin` in your browser.
     - Create a new database (e.g., `portfolio_db`).
     - Import any provided SQL files (if applicable) or configure the database connection in `config.php` (update credentials like `host`, `username`, `password`, and `database`).

4. **Run the Project**  
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost/Kishan-Personal-Portfolio`.
   - Voilà! The portfolio should now be running locally. 🎉

5. **Explore and Customize**  
   - Edit the `index.php` or other files to tweak the design or functionality.
   - Add your own flair by modifying CSS, JavaScript, or PHP scripts.

## 🌟 Hosting the Website

Want to take this portfolio live? Here’s how you can host it:

### Option 1: Local Hosting (XAMPP)
- Follow the setup steps above to run it locally for testing or development.

### Option 2: Free Hosting Platforms
- **GitHub Pages**: Suitable for static versions of the site (HTML/CSS/JS only).
  - Push the static files to a `gh-pages` branch.
  - Enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings.
- **Netlify/Vercel**: Deploy the static version for free with drag-and-drop or CLI.
     - Run `npm install` and `npm run build` if using Tailwind CSS.
    - Deploy the output folder (e.g., `dist/` or `public/`).
- **Free PHP Hosting**: Use platforms like **000webhost** or **InfinityFree** for PHP-based dynamic sites.
  - Upload the project files via FTP or the hosting provider’s file manager.
  - Configure the database if needed.

### Option 3: Paid Hosting
- Use providers like **Hostinger**, **Bluehost**, or **SiteGround** for reliable PHP hosting.
- Upload files via FTP and set up the database in the hosting control panel.

> 💡 **Note**: For dynamic features (like contact forms or quiz functionality), ensure your hosting supports PHP and MySQL. Free-tier hosting works great for testing, but paid hosting offers better performance and reliability.
